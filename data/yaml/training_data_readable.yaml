              - If the Description is empty/nan, INFER it from the Payee (e.g., "Uber" -> "Taxi Ride").
              - If you are unsure, use the '!' flag instead of '*'.
              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.
              4. **Entry:** Write the Beancount code.

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for internet service (British Telecom).
                            2. **Double Entry**:
                               - Credit Assets: Lloyds:Checking (debit side of transaction)
                               - Debit Expenses:Home:Internet (credit side of transaction)
                            3. **Inference**: The repeated "Wine-Tarner Cable" in context suggests a recurring expense for internet service, despite the Payee being British Telecom.

The description "Cable" likely refers to an internet bill. Despite the discrepancy in name, the context confirms a recurring expense for internet service.</step1>

                            1. Nature: Transfer of accumulated savings from checking account to another.
                                Since the Payee is "Unknown" and Description is generic, infer it as a **movement of funds** between accounts (common for personal transfers).
                                The context suggests an opening balance entry was already recorded under Equity:Opening-Balances, so this transaction likely adjusts the Assets:Lloyds:Checking account by reducing its balance.
                            2. Double Entry:
                                - Debit: Expense/Income account (since it’s a transfer of savings, not an expense/income event).
                                    * In Beancount, transfers between personal accounts are often recorded as **Expenses:Personal:Transfers** or similar.
                                - Credit: Assets:Lloyds:Checking (-4000.00 GBP) to match the negative amount rule.
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Payee is "Unknown" and Description is generic ("Transfering accumulated savings"), so infer this as a **personal transfer** of funds from checking account to another (e.g., savings, investment, or another bank).
                                The context confirms an opening balance was recorded under Equity:Opening-Balances, implying this transaction adjusts the Assets:Lloyds:Checking balance downward.
                            </step1>
                            <step2>Since it’s a transfer of funds (not an expense/income event), record it as an **Expense** to track the movement. The most appropriate category is:
                                Expenses:Personal:Transfers
                                This avoids misclassifying savings transfers as income/expense.

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for utility bill under "EDISON POWER" payee, inferred from context history.
                               Since the description is empty and the Payee matches historical entries for electricity, we categorize this as an expense for home electricity.
                            2. **Double Entry**:
                               - Debit: Assets:Citibank:Checking (negative amount)

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for recurring phone expenses (Verizon Wireless) based on historical context.
                               Since the transaction lacks a description but references Verizon in the history, it is inferred to be a phone-related expense.
                            2. **Double Entry**:
                               - Debit: Assets:Citibank:Checking (-79.98 USD)
                               - Credit: Expenses:Home:Phone (79.98 USD)
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Payee is "Comcast," but the context history shows repeated entries for Verizon Wireless under Expenses:Home:Phone.
                                Since no explicit description is provided, we infer this as a recurring charge related to phone services (e.g., bill payment or subscription renewal).
                            </step1>
                            <step2>Amount is -79.98 USD from the bank account, so the positive equivalent must be posted to an expense category.
                                The historical context confirms Expenses:Home:Phone as the appropriate category for phone-related expenses.

              - If you are unsure, use the '!' flag instead of '*'.
              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.

                            1. **Nature:** Payment for recurring phone expenses (likely a bill or subscription).
                               The context shows repeated entries under "Expenses:Home:Phone" for Verizon Wireless, suggesting this is a recurring charge.
                            2. **Double Entry:**
                               - Debit Assets:Citibank:Checking (negative amount)
                               - Credit Expenses:Home:Phone (positive amount)

The negative amount (-58.84 USD) is clearly a payment from the bank account.</step1>
                            <step2>The logic follows Beancount’s double-entry accounting:
                               - Assets (Bank) decrease by 58.84 USD.
                               - Expense category increases by 58.84 USD under "Expenses:Home:Phone."</step2>

                            <step2>Since the Payee is "Comcast" but no matching account exists in the provided context for Comcast, I will use the closest plausible category from the given examples (Expenses:Home:Phone) and assume it was an error. Alternatively, if this were a Comcast bill, it should be recorded under Expenses:Home:Internet or similar.
                            <step3>Given the ambiguity, I will proceed with the provided context's phone expense account but flag it as uncertain with '!' to indicate potential misclassification.</step3>

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for utility bill (Electricity) from Edison Power.
                            2. **Inference**: The Payee "American Energy" likely represents a broader category of utility providers, but the context history shows repeated entries under "Expenses:Home:Electricity." Given the lack of additional details in the description and the consistent account usage for similar transactions, we categorize this as an electricity expense.
                            3. **Double Entry**: Credit Assets:Citibank:Checking (debit side), Debit Expenses:Home:Electricity (credit side).
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>The Payee "American Energy" is not explicitly linked to the context history, but the repeated description "EDISON POWER" in the provided examples strongly suggests this transaction relates to electricity expenses. The account Expenses:Home:Electricity aligns with typical utility billing for residential power consumption.</step1>
                            <step2>The amount is negative (-65.0 USD), indicating an outflow from the bank, which must be recorded as a debit on the Assets:Citibank:Checking side. The positive equivalent (65.0 USD) is credited to the appropriate expense account.</step2>

                            1. **Nature:** Payment for recurring phone expenses (likely a bill or subscription).
                               Context history shows repeated entries under `Expenses:Home:Phone` for Verizon Wireless, implying this is a phone-related expense.
                            2. **Double Entry:**
                               - Debit the expense account (`Expenses:Home:Phone`) with **+70.13 USD** (positive side of transaction).
                               - Credit the bank account (`Assets:Citibank:Checking`) with **-70.13 USD** (negative side of transaction).

                            <step1>Payee is "Starlink" and description is "Cell Phone," but no direct match in history.
                                However, the context shows **three identical entries under `Expenses:Home:Phone` for Verizon Wireless**, suggesting this is a recurring phone-related expense (e.g., bill payment).
                                Since Starlink is not listed in history, assume it’s a misclassification or typo—**force-fit to `Expenses:Home:Phone`** due to context consistency.
                            </step1>
                            <step2>Amount validation:
                                - Transaction shows **-70.13 USD** from bank (correctly placed).
                                - Positive side must match the expense account; here, **+70.13 USD** is assigned to `Expenses:Home:Phone`.

                            2. **Inference**: Payee "American Energy" is likely a misclassification or typo for "Edison Power," which aligns with the context history of "Expenses:Home:Electricity."
                            3. **Double Entry**:
                               - Debit Assets:Citibank:Checking (negative amount).
                               - Credit Expenses:Home:Electricity (positive amount).
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>The Payee ("American Energy") does not match the context history explicitly, but "Edison Power" is a common utility provider for electricity. Given the repeated description in the context, it strongly suggests this is an electricity bill.</step1>

                               The context shows repeated entries under "Expenses:Home:Phone" for Verizon Wireless, implying this is a phone-related expense.

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for a recurring expense related to phone services.
                               The context shows repeated entries under "Expenses:Home:Phone" and the payee is not explicitly mentioned in the transaction description, but the history suggests this is a recurring charge for Verizon Wireless.
                            2. **Double Entry**:
                               - Debit Assets:Citibank:Checking (negative amount)
                               - Credit Expenses:Home:Phone
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>The Payee is "Comcast," but the description is empty and the context shows multiple entries under "Expenses:Home:Phone" with a payee of "Verizon Wireless." Since this transaction lacks explicit details, we infer it as a recurring charge for phone services (likely a bill or subscription) associated with Verizon Wireless. The source account is Assets:Citibank:Checking.</step1>
                            <step2>The amount is -79.74 USD, so the positive equivalent must be credited to Expenses:Home:Phone. This aligns with the recurring expense pattern observed in the history.</step2>

                                Since the description is vague and payee is "Unknown," infer that this represents a movement of funds for future use or investment, which typically falls under Equity adjustments.

                                - Credit Assets:BofA:Checking (negative amount as per instructions).

                            1. Nature: Transfer of accumulated savings from checking account to another.
                                Since the description is vague and payee is "Unknown," infer this as a **savings allocation** (common practice for moving funds internally).
                                The source account is Assets:BofA:Checking, so the negative amount must be recorded there.
                            2. Double Entry:
                                - Debit: Expenses:Savings-Allocation (if applicable) or Equity:Other (if no expense category exists)
                                - Credit: Assets:BofA:Checking (-4500.00 USD)

                            <step1>Payee is "Unknown" and description states a transfer of accumulated savings, implying an internal movement from checking to another account (e.g., high-yield savings or investment).</step1>
                            <step2>The context does not provide prior entries for this transaction type, so we assume it falls under **Equity:Savings-Allocation** if no expense category exists. If a dedicated "Savings Transfer" expense exists, use that instead.</step2>

              - If the Description is empty/nan, INFER it from the Payee (e.g., "Uber" -> "Taxi Ride").
              - If you are unsure, use the '!' flag instead of '*'.
              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.
              4. **Entry:** Write the Beancount code.
              - CRITICAL: The negative amount MUST go to: Assets:Barclays:Checking
              - The positive amount MUST go to the Expense/Income account.

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for a Starbucks purchase (repeated in history).
                               Since the description is empty and Payee is "Starbucks," infer it as an expense.
                            2. Double Entry:
                               - Debit: Expenses:Food:Starbucks (or create subaccount if needed)
                               - Credit: Assets:Barclays:Checking
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Context history shows multiple entries for "Starbucks" under Liabilities:US:Chase:Slate, implying a recurring expense. Since the Payee is Amazon (likely unrelated to Starbucks) and description is missing, assume this is an error or miscommunication. However, given the provided transaction details, we will proceed with the most plausible interpretation:
                                - The "Starbucks" in context likely refers to a prior charge that was incorrectly attributed here.
                                - Since Payee is Amazon (likely unrelated), we infer this as a generic expense entry for a purchase made via Barclays account. We'll categorize it under Expenses:Food:General.

              Instructions:
              1. **Analyze:** Look at the Payee and Description. Check the <context> for history.
              2. **Plan:** Decide the Account (e.g., Expenses:Food).
              - If the Description is empty/nan, INFER it from the Payee (e.g., "Uber" -> "Taxi Ride").
              - If you are unsure, use the '!' flag instead of '*'.
              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.
              4. **Entry:** Write the Beancount code.
              - CRITICAL: The negative amount MUST go to: Assets:Barclays:Checking
              - The positive amount MUST go to the Expense/Income account.

                            1. **Nature**: Payment for subscription service.
                            2. **Inference from Context**: The repeated "Starbucks" entries in the context suggest this is a recurring expense category, likely "Expenses:Food:Coffee". However, since the Payee is Spotify and there's no explicit description, we infer it as a "Subscription Service".
                            3. **Double Entry**:
                               - Debit: Expense account (Expenses:Entertainment:Music).
                               - Credit: Assets:Barclays:Checking.

                            <step1>Payee is Spotify, which strongly implies a subscription expense. The absence of a description defaults to "Subscription Service" for clarity.</step1>
                            <step2>The amount (12.99 GBP) matches typical monthly subscription costs for streaming services like Spotify. No conflicting history in the provided context suggests otherwise.</step2>

                               Since "Virgin Media" is a common name for UK broadband/internet providers, this aligns with typical recurring expenses.
                            2. **Double Entry**:
                               - Credit Assets:Barclays:Checking (debit side of the transaction)

                            <step2>Amount: -86.25 GBP (outflow from bank) → Debit Expense account.
                                   Positive side must be an Expense account; "Expenses:Home:Internet" is the most precise category for Virgin Media bills.

                                - **Internet** (new subcategory).

                                - **Phone**: 35.63 GBP (~50%)

                            1. Nature: Transfer of accumulated savings from checking account to another.
                                Since the Payee is "Unknown" and Description lacks specifics, infer this as a **movement of funds** between accounts (common for personal transfers).
                                The context suggests an opening balance entry was recorded earlier under Equity:Opening-Balances, implying this is a **reallocation of liquid assets**.
                            2. Double Entry:
                                - Debit the Source Account (Assets:Natwest:Checking) with **-3500.0 GBP** (withdrawal).
                                - Credit an appropriate Equity account to reflect the transfer’s impact on net worth.
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Payee is "Unknown" and Description explicitly states a transfer of accumulated savings, implying this is a **fund movement** rather than a transaction with a third party.</step1>
                            <step2>The context confirms an opening balance was recorded under Equity:Opening-Balances. This suggests the transfer is part of a broader asset reallocation strategy (e.g., moving funds to another account for investment or savings).</step2>
                            <step3>Since no specific destination account is provided, we assume this is a **liquid asset adjustment** and credit Equity:Savings-Allocation (a common Beancount convention for such transfers).</step3>

                               - Payee "EE Broadband" suggests a mobile/internet service (likely broadband).
                               - Description "TV & Internet" aligns with EE's offerings, confirming the expense category.
                               - History shows prior Verizon Wireless entries under `Expenses:Home:Phone`, but no direct internet context. However, EE is a major UK telecom provider offering both TV and broadband services—**assumed to be broadband-related**.
                            3. **Double Entry:**
                               - Credit Assets:Natwest:Checking (debit side).
                               - Debit Expenses:Home:Internet (credit side) due to the primary expense being internet.

              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.

                            1. **Nature:** Payment for broadband services (TV & Internet).
                               - The Payee is "EE Broadband," and the Description includes "TV & Internet."
                               - Context history shows prior Verizon Wireless entries under Expenses:Home:Phone.
                               - Since EE Broadband is a mobile/internet provider, we infer this is an **Expenses:Home:Broadband** entry (split between TV/Internet).

                                - No prior history matches exactly, but EE is a mobile/internet provider.
                                - Default to Expenses:Home:Broadband (general category).

                            <step2>Amount: -71.27 GBP from Bank → +71.27 GBP to Broadband expense.
                                - If further granularity is needed, split into:
                                    * Expenses:Home:TV
                                    * Expenses:Home:Internet
                                - Here, we use a single line for simplicity unless context dictates otherwise.

                            1. Nature: Transfer of accumulated savings from Assets to Equity.
                                - Since the transaction is a movement between accounts (not an expense/income), it should be recorded as a **reclassification entry** in equity or a temporary adjustment.
                            2. Double Entry:
                                - Credit Assets:Natwest:Checking (-3800.0 GBP) to reflect outflow.
                                - Debit Equity:Savings-Adjustments (+3800.0 GBP) as a reclassification entry for accumulated savings transfer.
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Payee is "Unknown" and description explicitly states "Transfering accumulated savings to other account." This indicates an internal movement of funds, not an expense or income event.</step1>
                            <step2>The context does not provide prior equity adjustments for this account, so we assume the transfer is recorded as a **reclassification** under Equity:Savings-Adjustments (or similar).</step2>
                            <step3>Beancount requires double-entry accounting. The negative amount (-3800.0 GBP) must be posted to Assets:Natwest:Checking, and the positive equivalent (+3800.0 GBP) must be posted to an equity account to maintain balance.</step3>

                                Since the Payee is "Unknown" and Description is vague, infer that this is a **movement of funds** (not an expense/income).
                                The context suggests an opening balance entry was recorded earlier under Equity:Opening-Balances, implying this is a **funds transfer** from Assets to Equity.

                               - The Payee "EE Broadband" aligns with the context history of recurring Verizon Wireless/EE-related expenses under Expenses:Home:Phone.
                               - Given the ambiguity between phone and internet, we default to **Expenses:Home:Internet** as EE is a major broadband provider in the UK (though historically known for mobile).

                                Since the Payee is "Unknown" and the Description explicitly states a transfer, this is an internal movement within assets.
                                The context suggests no prior expense/income classification exists for this transaction; thus, it should be recorded as a **reclassification** under Equity:Savings-Transfers or similar.

                               - Since Verizon Wireless is listed under Expenses:Home:Phone in the history, I infer that EE likely falls under **Expenses:Home:Internet** (as TV could be bundled with internet services).

                               - Debit Expenses:Home:Internet +71.27 GBP for the expense.

                               Since the Payee is Apple and the description "Payroll" does not match, infer this as a misclassified or generic salary entry.
                               The context shows repeated entries under `Income:US:Hooli:Salary`, so we will use that account for positive flow.

                            1. **Nature**: This is a payroll payment to Hooli, inferred from the repeated "Hooli Payroll" description in context and the absence of other payee details.
                               - The transaction aligns with Income:US:Hooli:Salary per historical pattern.

                            1. **Nature:** This is a payroll expense for Hooli employees, as indicated by the repeated "Hooli Payroll" description in the context and the source account being a salary income.
                               - The transaction appears to be a payment from Microsoft (Payee) to an employee or entity associated with Hooli, which aligns with the Income:US:Hooli:Salary category.
                            2. **Double Entry:**
                                - Debit: Expense account (Income:US:Hooli:Salary)
                                - Credit: Assets:Natwest:Checking
                        </plan>
                        <reasoning>
                            <step1>Payee is Microsoft, and the description "Payroll" combined with the context history of "Income:US:Hooli:Salary" strongly suggests this is a salary payment to an employee or entity under Hooli. The amount (2600 GBP) is consistent with typical payroll disbursements.</step1>
                            <step2>The source account is Assets:Natwest:Checking, so the negative amount must be recorded there. The positive amount should go to the Income/Expense account derived from the context history.</step2>

                               - If this were an actual Hooli paycheck, the correct account would be **Income:US:Hooli:Salary**.
                               - However, since the Payee is "Apple" and no further context aligns with Hooli, I will assume this is a **correction or mislabel** and proceed with the provided transaction details.

                            <step2>The amount is 2600.00 GBP, which should be recorded as a positive income entry (Salary) and offset by a negative debit to the bank account.
                               - If this were truly an Apple-related expense (e.g., stock purchase), it would require additional context. Since no such context exists, I will record it under **Income:US:Hooli:Salary** despite the Payee mismatch.

              - If the Description is empty/nan, INFER it from the Payee (e.g., "Uber" -> "Taxi Ride").
              - If you are unsure, use the '!' flag instead of '*'.
              3. **Reasoning:** Explain your logic step-by-step.
              4. **Entry:** Write the Beancount code.
              - CRITICAL: The negative amount MUST go to: Assets:Natwest:Checking
              - The positive amount MUST go to the Expense/Income account.

                            1. **Nature:** Salary payment from Hooli to Microsoft (likely a payroll-related expense for the employee).
                               Given the repeated "Hooli Payroll" description in context, this is an income entry.
                            2. **Double Entry:**
                                - Debit: Income:US:Hooli:Salary (positive amount)
                                - Credit: Assets:Natwest:Checking (negative amount, as per instructions)
                        </plan>

                            <step1>Payee is Microsoft and the description "Payroll" aligns with the context of Hooli Payroll. This indicates a salary-related transaction.</step1>
                            <step2>The repeated examples in `<context>` confirm that Income:US:Hooli:Salary is the correct income account for this payroll entry.</step2>
                            <step3>Amount is 2600.0 GBP, so:
                                - Debit: +2600.0 GBP to Income:US:Hooli:Salary
                                - Credit: -2600.0 GBP to Assets:Natwest:Checking (as per instructions)

                            1. Nature: This is a debit to an expense account for Google Cloud services, likely related to computing credits (e.g., refund or discount).

The description "Temp Payroll" aligns with a salary-related expense, despite the payee mismatch.

                            <step2>The amount (£2600 GBP) is clearly a gross income entry, not an expense. The source account (Assets:Natwest:Checking) must be debited negatively to reflect the outflow of funds.</step2>
